<title>About Me</title>
<p>My interest in the IT industry began during my Physics course at the University of Kent. 
I was introduced to programming languages like Fortran 95 and MATLAB which I used to complete assignments. 
The nature of my degree enabled me to become a more analytically minded person,
 having really enjoyed writing code during one of my modules I became very interested in pursuing 
a career within the technology industry.</p>
